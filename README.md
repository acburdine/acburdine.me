# acburdine.me
Repository for my personal website

This is a simple one-page HTML website written with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and the [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) theme, with some of my own modifications.

It also has a basic contact form written in PHP using SwiftMailer.

### Installation Steps (you must have php installed to use the contact form)

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/acburdine/acburdine.com path/to/clone/directory/`
2. `cd path/to/clone/directory/`
3. If you don't have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed, get it: `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php` (check out composer's website for more documentation)
4. Run the composer install `php composer.phar install`
5. Point your webserver to `/public` as your document root.
